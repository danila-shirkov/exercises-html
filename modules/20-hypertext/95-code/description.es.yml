name: Inserting computer code into HTML
theory: |

  When creating educational programming blogs or writing articles, there is a need to demonstrate code. Each lesson on Code Basics has such blocks:

  ```html
  <p>Here you can see the markup</p>
  ```

  To create a code block, the `<code>` tag is used, inside which code in any programming language is written.

  ```javascript
  // Example JavaScript code
  const square = (num) => {
    return num * num;
  };
  ```

  The `<code>` tag is often used together with the `<pre>` tag, which allows preserving formatting. If the `<pre>` tag is not used, line breaks need to be controlled manually, for example, by wrapping each line in the `<p>` tag.

  It is important that all tags inside `<code>` will be processed by the browser, which is why special characters are used inside. Another common solution is to wrap the tag name in a separate tag, for example `<span>`:

  ```html
  <code>
    &lt;<span>p</span>&gt;Inserting the p tag as plain text &lt;<span>/p</span>&gt;
  </code>
  ```

  Add any text to the `<code>` tag and insert it into the editor. Try different variations of text.
