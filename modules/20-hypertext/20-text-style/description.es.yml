name: Text Formatting
theory: |

  Any text contains key parts that you want to convey to the reader. These can be definitions, tips, or key ideas. If there is a lot of text, such parts can be lost or not be discovered at all. How can you help the browser and the user quickly find such parts on the page? In HTML markup, you can use **bold** and _italic_ formatting for these purposes.

  ## Bold Formatting

  To highlight text in bold, one of two paired tags is used: `<b>` or `<strong>`:

  ```html
  <p>Code Basics — <b>programming</b> courses.</p>
  ```

  <div class="hexlet-basics-example my-3">
    <p class="m-0">Code Basics — <b>programming</b> courses.</p>
  </div>

  ```html
  <p>HTML — <strong>hypertext markup language</strong></p>
  ```

  <div class="hexlet-basics-example my-3">
    <p class="m-0">HTML — <strong>hypertext markup language</strong></p>
  </div>

  Both examples illustrate adding bold formatting to a section of text. But why were two different tags used for visually identical results? It's all about _semantics_, or the meaning. In this case, the meaning of the tag is:

  * `<b>` — simple text highlighting. It can be used anywhere to visually highlight text. This tag does not carry any semantic load.
  * `<strong>` — logical emphasis on an important part of the text. This tag carries semantic meaning and marks the important part. It should not be applied to all parts indiscriminately.

  At one time, developers wanted these tags to look different and behave differently for browsers, but history took a slightly different path. It is now considered redundant to use `<b>` for visual highlighting, and CSS should be used for visual highlighting, while `<strong>` should be used for important parts.

  ## Italic Formatting

  In terms of meaning, italic formatting is very similar to bold formatting, but it emphasizes not a key part, but rather adds emphasis. For example:

  ```html
  <p><i>Code Basics</i> — <em>free courses</em> on programming</p>
  ```

  <div class="hexlet-basics-example my-3">
    <p class="m-0"><i>Code Basics</i> — <em>free courses</em> on programming</p>
  </div>

  In this example, two parts of the text were marked up:

  * The `<i>` tag was used to mark the name of the Code Basics portal. The tag is intended for visually highlighting text in italics and does not carry any semantic load.
  * The `<em>` tag was used to highlight the phrase "free courses". This is a logical emphasis on the free nature of the courses, which was given to the sentence. There are many courses, but there are no free ones, so it is worth adding emphasis to this part of the sentence.

  Add the phrase

  <div class="hexlet-basics-example my-3">
    <span>Hexlet — hands-on programming courses</span>
  </div>

  to the editor, where you should make the word "courses" bold (physical formatting) and emphasize the combination "programming" in italics (logical formatting). Don't forget to wrap the phrase in a paragraph.

  - name: Semantics
    description: The meaning. In the context of HTML, it refers to the semantic choice of markup for a piece of information.
tips:
  - Tags for visual highlighting are shorter than those for semantic highlighting. This will help you remember when to use `<i>` and `<b>`, and when to use `<em>` and `<strong>`.
  - In practice, CSS is used for styling instead of `<i>` and `<b>`.
